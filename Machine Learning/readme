## How To Use
### Deploy to localhost 
1. Clone the repository 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/avocadojj/Foodicitive-ML.git
   ```
2. open terminal and move to this directory
   ```
   cd Foodictive-ML
   ```
3. Use anaconda or create virtual environment
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. For windows, Activate virtual environment
   ```
   venv\Scripts\activate (windows)
   source venv/bin/activate (Mac / Linux) 
   ```
5. Install the requirements
   ```
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the app
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
### Applied .tflite to Android
The model in this repository is designed to run on android applications. The following is a documentation guide for using the .tflite model in android studio (We use kotlin)
1. Do instance your model in model variable
   ```
   val model = YourModel.newInstance(this)
   ```
2. Take image in bitmap then insert to image variable
   ```
   val image = TensorImage.fromBitmap(bitmap)
   ```
3. Do prediction on image, use list for descending then give list to outputs variable.
   ```
   val outputs = model.process(image).probabilityAsCategoryList.apply {
      sortByDescending { it.score }
   }
   ```
4. Access outputs[0] for class that have biggest accuracy then give to probability variable
   ```
   val probability = outputs[0]
   ```

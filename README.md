Climate change is a hot topic that many people are talking about in 2022. The reason is that several scientists in the United States of America (USA) staged a massive protest against climate change. Everyone knows that the reforestation process is one of the most influential ways to prevent climate change. We hope that the application that we made can help the reforestation process. Now, the question is how effectively this application can help the greening process? Of course, this application is designed to give enthusiasm and motivation to everyone to start the reforestation process. In this application, we can get information about a plant and make it a place to store our plant collection in the form of an inventory. With the presence of this application, it is hoped that it can make users more diligent in caring for and maintaining plants accompanied by adequate knowledge about the plants they care for and maintain. With this application, we indirectly play a role in the reforestation process and we can help prevent climate change by starting with ourselves.
